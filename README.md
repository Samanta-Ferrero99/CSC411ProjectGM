## Run in eclipse.

To run project in eclipse you will need jdk-16.0.2 as your JRE System Library. If you do not have that version, download from "https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html". 

Clone into this repository, import project as java. 
Configure buildpath to contain only jdk-16.0.2. It will cause error if another jdk version is used. 

Once the project is loaded on eclipse, you can run it by right clicking on the file named Main.java. On the console it will print out three questions, one at a time. The answers to those must be int, int, float. It will crash otherwise. After those three questions it will run, show terminated. You can then reload the project and open the solution.txt file and the game selections will be there.

To add or delete games in the project, edit the "file.txt" file.
